## About
This website uses the GIPHY API to dynamically load GIFs of the provided animal. More images of the same animal can be appended, and GIF category buttons can also be dynamically added by the user. Hovering over the GIF will show title and rating information, and clicking the GIF will toggle the animated or still version of the image. Ajax is used to asynchronously request the GIFs, while Javascript and jQuery is used to change the HTML.
